# Exploration of Trap and Dubstep through YouTube and Spotify Data - IT299 Project

A Python webscraping, data exploration, visualization, and dashboard hosting project.

## Introduction

This dashboard allows you to explore the electronic bass music genres of Trap and Dubstep through YouTube and Spotify data. 
Tracks related to these genres were gathered by scraping five popular music-discovering channels on YouTube: TrapNation, TrapCity, BassNation, UKFDubstep, and DubRebellion. 
Audio features data was tied to those that could be found in Spotifyâ€™s library.
